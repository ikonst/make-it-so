HelloWorldWithStaticLibrary_ImplicitlyLinked
--------------------------------------------

HelloApp links TextLibrary implicitly, by having a dependency on it
and the linker flag LinkLibraryDependencies is Yes (the default for exes).

It does not explicitly include TextLibrary in the library path or in the 
list of addition libraries to link.
